<h2>Some Things To Consider About Mirror Tiles</h2>

    When it comes to using mirrored tiles in a home installation, there are a few things worth reviewing. Here are some drawbacks of choosing mirrored tiles over other reflective surfaces:

    Affordability vs. Installation Costs
  </h3>

      <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0;">&#9679;</span>
      Mirror tiles are small, making them easy to warehouse and ship. This makes them readily available online and in stores at inexpensive prices.

      <span style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0;">&#9679;</span>
      However, while the tiles themselves are cheap, the installation process can be expensive. Mirror is a fragile and difficult building material to work with, requiring skilled labor for a polished look.

    Mirror Tile Project Considerations
  </h2>
  <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 8px;">
    <strong>1. Distortion:</strong> All mirror tiles have distortion, primarily due to the glue used to bond them to the surface. This creates a high spot in each tile. While thicker glass reduces distortion, it's almost always present.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 8px;">
    <strong>2. Installation:</strong> Mirror tile installation is unique compared to other tiled products. Experienced tile setters might not have the specific technique for mirror tiles. Techniques that work for ceramic tiles might not be effective for mirror tiles.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 8px;">
    <strong>3. Cost:</strong> Despite being inexpensive, the complexity of installing mirror tiles can make the overall project cost comparable to, or even more expensive than, using a single large mirror.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 8px;">
    <strong>4. Fragility:</strong> Mirror tiles, especially those made from thin glass, are fragile and susceptible to breaking due to impacts or heat exposure. This is a common concern for all glass products, but it's more prominent with thinner glass.
